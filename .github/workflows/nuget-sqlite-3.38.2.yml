#
# The version part is immutable in the name, but the package revision
# component after the dash should be kept in sync with `PKG_REV`.
# GitHub doesn't allow variables in the workflow names, so this cannot
# be automated.
#
# For new SQLite versions, rename this file with a new version name
# to restart build numbers from `1`. This is necessary because GitHub
# maintains build numbers per workflow file name.

name: SQLite v3.38.2-1

#
# When `publish-package` is set to `yes`, the workflow will build
# the package and publish it to nuget.org. Otherwise, a package
# will be built as an artifact and may be downloaded via GitHub UI.
#
# Published Nuget package will use the 4th version component as a
# package revision number because Nuget lacks package revision
# support.
#
# Without publishing, a Nuget package will be uploaded as a workflow
# artifact and will be named using a pre-release version, which is
# an unfortunate workaround for a lack of build promotion support
# between GitHub and Nuget. This means that true pre-release packages
# will conflict with CI packages, but for this repository this is
# not an issue that will ever need to be addressed.
