  For static library projects, Visual Studio merges additional static
  libraries, like these included here, into the target static libraries
  for their projects. This creates bloated static libraries that are
  hard to troubleshoot. Avoid adding packaged static libraries into
  projects that generate their own static libraries.

    Both libraries will appear in the Visual Studio project, but only
    one of them will be included in the build, based on whether the
    selected configuration is set as debug or release, as indicated
    by UseDebugLibraries, which is available in all standard Visual
    Studio projects.

    UseDebugLibraries is described in {VS2022}\Msbuild\Microsoft\VC\v170\1033\general_advanced.xml
